1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,160


2
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:45,065
Installing ComfyUI

3
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:51,719
Let's see what I wrote. From point 1, download the Install file, which if

4
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,600
My friends just came in. My installation file is stored in this script file folder.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,800
Friends come here f Install vui on Run port

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,360
Here, all the scripts are ready. My friends can download them and use them. Just press

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,159
Download here

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:21,479
If you look closely, the file looks similar to the file used in Google Colab, but

9
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,320
The codes are not very similar, so they cannot be used together. Google calab must be used with colab.

10
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Runpod is used with Runpod, which I wrote specifically for use with Runpod.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:41,840
So when we get here, we have a simple method, we download the file that we downloaded.

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,759
Then, just throw this file in here. Right? Drag it here. You will see a green frame in here.

13
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh, throw the dots in the frame. So when it's done, the file will be in here, which is the file.

14
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,799
It's a small file, it's a script, the text isn't very big, just double-click it to open it.

15
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,599
This will all look similar to colab if you've ever used Google colab.

16
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,840
It will be a cell called cell 1 with the number 1 in it, which is the script.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,000
What I wrote here is like a comment, which has no script to read.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Write it as a general note and then in the second cell, your friends will have this. Note that if we press

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,680
When will there be a blue bar next to it? It's activated in this script, right? So let's go back.

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Go to Code script 1 and go back and look at the manual. What I did was Chapter 2 here.

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,480
So the download is complete, upload the file to Jupiter lab, that's what we did earlier.

22
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,239
What I'm going to show you is just throw it in. Let's start running the script. It's that simple.

23
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,239
Run the script, press activate this cell once, anywhere, so that it blinks.

24
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,159
Blink, see the blue bar next to it, then press the run button, it's here, friends.

25
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:16,799
Look at the picture and follow the steps. Make it the same by pressing the button. If anyone can't hear it in time, you can go back and watch it again.

26
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,040
Press "Beep" processing setup Complete

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,519
Ah, go to Next Step, which means the first step will be completed quickly, then press ah, step 2 is

28
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,840
In cell 2, right? Or look at the example here, which is to start running the script in the cell.

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:43,120
2. Click this and press Run. This script is now cloning.

30
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,640
repo of comfy ui, guys, notice that it will download the folder comfy.

31
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,680
ui is like that, so step 1 compete, if you want to continue or not, press Yes No, right?

32
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,840
Let your friends type the word Yes YES and press Enter, which is considered to be the completion of this step.

33
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,720
confirm is step 2. Next is this. I'm explaining that step 2 is when we clone.

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,519
confyui comes from repo, right? Repo is me. Git clone. If anyone installs in Git, it's Git.

35
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,880
Clone comes from git Clone. This is from the official Comfy UI website.

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:32,600
Step 3 is this step, we press in this cell and then press Run.

37
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,880
This step is called the step of creating a Virtual **Environment**.

38
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:47,800
He will create a folder named venv here. Oh, friends, you can also check if it happens.

39
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,680
If it can be created, if it doesn't, then I'll PM you later. You can tell me and I'll fix the code.
