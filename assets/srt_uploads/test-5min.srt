[welcome to Comfyui Tutorials by iimate24]

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,599
Today, I will try to install ComfyUI manually. You can use it without using a script.

3
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,840
What do you type? We use Runpod, and today we are using Runpod Command Line at

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,360
Terminal, which we are now in this workspace directory is the workspace.

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
So the first thing we're going to do is copy the comfyui Github directory.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,559
I think my friends probably have this link. The way to do it is to come here and press this button: copy to clipboard.

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,359
Then we come back to our terminal page in runpod. How to install Runpod, etc.

8
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,239
I think most of my friends can do it already, but if it's a new friend, try going back and looking at

9
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,239
This is the first episode of the series so the download method is easy, we will use the word

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,479
Say Git clone and then Ctrl + V the link that we copied and Enter on the left hand side here.

11
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,840
A ComfyUI folder pops up indicating that we have successfully downloaded it, but

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,640
If it is still downloading, please wait here for it to finish. After a while, the download speed will be around the same.

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,680
Download speed of this is around 900 MB per second on the server I use.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,000
Now, I am using RTX5080 with 83 GB RAM, but the graphics card RAM is 16 GB. The download is complete.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,840
And it will look something like this. Next, we will create a Virtual Environment.

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,240
Use the command python -m venv myvenv

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,320
Then followed by the name of the virtual environment.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:57,680
What we want to set, let's say we want to set today as myvenv.

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,479
Then press Enter and this folder will be created.

20
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,320
folder virtual environment which we can name it as anything we want

21
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:13,360
We want but when we call we will call us by using command to activate source my

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,959
venv bin and then activate we will use this command

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,200
That is, we will have a folder called activate inside this folder if we double-click on it.

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,450
Click myvenv in bin

25
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,519
And then in here, there will be a file called

26
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:39,680
activate We will call this file. Press activate. We will have comfyUI.

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
We have the environment, then we have to install it.

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,360
install ComfyUI using this command, scroll down the mouse, we will select here because we use

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,480
Nvidia GPU cards now have 2 commands, the first command of the person using the normal version

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,720
In general, you can just copy this. But for me, I will install the Nightly version and it is for

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,640
For 50xx graphics cards, we will copy this directly and paste it into the command line.

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,239
After installing, when it installs, it will work like this in the background. It will load.

33
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,360
Many files are coming down, and this step should take about 20 minutes.

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,200
Okay, the installation is complete. If it comes up like this, it means it's done.

35
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,239
Once done we can continue working. You will notice that it downloads the package.

36
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,360
Various things to use in comfyUI, namely a list of everything it has.

37
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,560
install See? But we haven't finished installing it yet. We still have to install the requirements.

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,879
ComfyUI's too, and the way to use it is 1. We have to go into the ComfyUI Folder.

39
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,560
What you do is type the word CD and then type C because Python, um, Linux is like that.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,920
Like case sensitive, it means big and small.

41
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,159
Type in lowercase c, we will not see it. Type in C and press tab once, we will see it automatically.

42
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,680
complete stay here Enter this is the command now we are in the folder of

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:20,359
comfyUI How to see the details inside, press ls -la and then we press Enter, which we

44
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,880
I want to see what files it has, which we need is requirement.txt.

45
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,479
Inside here, in this file, we can actually see it in requirements. We double-click.

46
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,160
From here, you can see the details inside. See? These are the packages that we need to install.

47
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,280
But when we install, we don't have to install them one by one. We don't have to type install one by one.

48
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,960
Use the command pip install -r requirement.txt

49
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,080
install and then there is a delete r which is delete r which is it will automatically install every package that it puts in.

50
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,520
When you come here, we call the file name. Requirements are the same as before. Press the small r.
